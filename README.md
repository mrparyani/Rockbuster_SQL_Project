As part of the Data Analytics Course, SQL was utilized to work on a project for Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company that previously operated stores worldwide.

## Background
In response to increasing competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster Stealth LLC intends to leverage their existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to remain competitive.

##Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has posed a series of business questions and is seeking data-driven answers to inform their 2020 company strategy. These questions include:

Which movies have contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
What is the average rental duration for all videos?
In which countries are Rockbuster customers located?
Where are customers with high lifetime value based?
Do sales figures vary by geographic region?


## Data Set
The data set is a relational database comprising 17 tables, including films, customers, payments, and actors, among others.
